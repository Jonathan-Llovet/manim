# Opening Questions Manim

## About
Code for videos on [Opening Questions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQ5gGxixCkYamF5S3sU1hA) Youtube channel.

Opening Questions is here to make resources for people to learn and engage with computer science, programming, math and science (and how they have developed throughout history), and philosophy.

Projects with source code will have links to their own repositories.

Animations can be found in [opening-questions-manim/opening\_questions](https://github.com/Jonathan-Llovet/opening-questions-manim/tree/master/opening_questions)

The animations are made with the manim math animation engine, which was originally made by Grant Sanderson for 3b1b. Many thanks to Grant for creating this powerful tool, sharing it with the world, and making videos that help us see what's wonderful about math.
You can find the original manim repository here:

I have included extensions of manim provided by the community. Many thanks to Alexander VÃ¡zquez (Elteoremadebeethoven) for being so helpful with learning manim and supporting the community.
